## 🧠 Is it a Palindrome?

A simple web app that checks whether a given word or sentence is a **palindrome** — a text that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spaces.

### 🚀 Demo

💡 *A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.*

Example:
madam → ✅ palindrome
racecar → ✅ palindrome
hello → ❌ not a palindrome

### 🛠️ Built With

- **HTML5**
- **Tailwind CSS** – for modern, responsive styling  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – for palindrome checking logic  

---

### ⚙️ How It Works

1. The user enters a word or sentence in the input field.  
2. When clicking **Check**, the script:
   - Removes spaces and punctuation.
   - Converts all letters to lowercase.
   - Compares the string with its reversed version.  
3. Displays whether the input is a palindrome or not.
